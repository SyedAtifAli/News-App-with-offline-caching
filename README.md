# News-App-with-offline-caching(Using Mvvm + Retrofit + Room db)

This is a project (working) to show case local caching of custom news objects into room database using mvvm architechture and latest jetpack architechture components.
You can implement the rest (filters) using simple room db @Query(....) and the ui has already been done with data binding!

Do give a star or fork this repo if you think this helped you even a little!
Cheers!!
